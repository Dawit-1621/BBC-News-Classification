    "News is easily accessible via content providers such as online news services. A huge amount of information exists in form of text in various diverse areas whose analysis can be beneficial in several areas. Classification is quite a challenging field in text mining as it requires prepossessing steps to convert unstructured data to structured information. With the increase in the number of news it has got difficult for users to access news of his interest which makes it a necessity to categories news so that it could be easily accessed. Categorization refers to grouping that allows easier navigation among articles. Internet news needs to be divided into categories"
